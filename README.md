# Simple Interest Calculator

This project contains a Bash script named `simple-interest.sh` that calculates simple interest based on user input.

## How It Works
The script asks the user to enter:
- Principal amount (P)
- Rate of interest (R)
- Time period in years (T)

It then calculates the simple interest using the formula:

Simple Interest = (P × R × T) / 100

## How to Run the Script
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the script.
3. Run the command:

```bash
bash simple-interest.sh
