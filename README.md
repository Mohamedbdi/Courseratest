# Simple Interest Calculator

This project contains a Bash script named `simple-interest.sh` that calculates simple interest based on user input.  
The script asks the user to enter:

- Principal amount  
- Rate of interest  
- Time period (in years)

It then computes the simple interest using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100
